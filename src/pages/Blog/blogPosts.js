    title: "Flexibility is top priority for sports event organisers",
    description:
      "Athena, the iconic Art Deco events venue in Leicester’s vibrant cultural quarter, has conducted new research shedding light on the top priorities of sports event organisers. The research revealed that flexibility is the key priority for sports event organisers, who also place a high value on independent venues and in-house teams. Planners highlighted the importance of flexibility in relation to venue space, service, and event packages. They showed a preference for independent venues for their adaptability, bespoke agile service, and wide range of flexible packages to suit events of every calibre. Many stated that in-house venue teams for production and catering allow for greater customisation and flexibility on budgets, too. Value emerged as a key talking point, too, as event planners have been experiencing rising event costs in the past year. Some are apprehensive about passing these costs onto attendees through increased ticket prices. There’s a shared concern that higher ticket prices could deter potential attendees, resulting in decreased event participation. Consequently, planners are continuing to deliver exceptional experiences while balancing the greater need for value. For example, Gail Rushton, Development Officer of England Hockey, found that choosing a stand-out venue located in the centre of the UK has helped. She explained: “We have used Athena multiple times for England Hockey’s national events due to its central UK location”, which makes the venue more easily accessible and cost-effective for the hockey community. Dominic Musgrave, Director of Operations for the National Fitness Awards, echoed the sentiment, and added: “We are always conscious of providing value for attendees. Our directors wanted the National Fitness Awards to have a ‘black-tie and red-carpet feel’ with a three-course dinner for 800 people, which Athena can provide. It’s about delivering exceptional experiences while also ensuring value for attendees.” Athena’s independence also means it is well placed to provide customised packages based on their clients’ needs. Hira Ram, Events Manager at Athena, explained the motive behind the research. She said: “We conducted this research to understand the challenges faced by planners and attendees, particularly for sporting events. As an independent venue, we take pride in offering a stylish, heritage venue with modern capabilities but also seamless execution, unique experiences, customised support, packages, and service.",

    title: "ExCeL London launches new partnerships plans",
    description:
      "London’s leading event venue ExCeL has today announced a new long-term partnerships strategy aimed at further unlocking growth beyond its core events business. Hosting around 400 events every year and welcoming four million visitors, the Royal Docks venue is currently experiencing its busiest ever year – tracking 10% higher than its previous record set before the pandemic in 2019. As a result of growing demand, the venue is in the final stages of a 25,000sqm expansion programme – opening in October 2024 – together with ongoing redevelopment plans to host more family and immersive experiences in line with recent events such as Disney100: The Exhibition, Formula E and Jurassic World: The Exhibition. The new project will be led by consultant Jonathan Neill who will work with the existing ExCeL commercial team to create and implement new partnerships for the venue. Neill boasts more than 25 years’ industry experience working with major brands such as The O2, Visit Britain and Barclays bank. Speaking on the announcement, ExCeL’s Chief Commercial Officer Simon Mills said: “London’s event industry is thriving and ExCeL sits in the heart of that, experiencing our busiest year yet with booming visitor numbers and contributing approximately 25% of all inbound business tourism to the capital. “The timing is now right to expand this position and to explore avenues outside our core business and our wider 100-acre estate. We’re very excited about our long-term growth plans and know Jonathan has the experience and business prowess to deliver this.” Neill added: “ExCeL makes connections, drives innovation, and is a real symbol of collaboration and creativity. With the venue’s expansion plans and continued development of live attractions, we’re looking forward to developing our partnership proposition, engaging with new like-minded brands and working together to create partnerships that add real value.” Certified carbon neutral, ExCeL will now continue its packed programme of events this year including major events such as MCM Comic Con, Disney 100: The Exhibition, Kingdom of Winter and the London International Horse Show, as well as leading corporate conferences, congresses and exhibitions including World Travel Market and Brand Licencing Europe.",

    title: "Live Nation is selling $25 tickets to thousands",
    description:
      "When was the last time you bought a concert ticket for $25? Live Nation is making it possible to see several of your favourite artists for cheap this summer with their newly launched Concert Week. The promotion allows Canadian and American fans access to all-in tickets to more than 3,800 live shows across both countries, with ticket prices as low as $25. Concert Week kicks off Wednesday, May 10, at 10 a.m. ET and lasts until May 16. So how does this work? There are at least 300 artists from a broad range of genres included in the promotion. Available concerts include chart-toppers like Maroon 5, Charlie Puth, Shania Twain and Janet Jackson, along with rap and R&B legends like Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa, TLC and Shaggy. The bands Mötley Crüe, Disturbed and Fall Out Boy are also among the artists listed by Live Nation. Users can filter through tickets based on artist name or the location of the concerts they’re looking to attend. A variety of seat types will be available for sale. In Canada, those who bank with RBC were given early access to Live Nation Concert Week. On Tuesday at 10 a.m., RBC clients who applied for an access code were given exclusive entry to try and score discounted concert tickets. (Depending on the province or state of residence, additional fees and taxes for tickets purchased during Live Nation Concert Week may vary.) The tickets are certain to sell out quickly, as the average price of a concert ticket has nearly quadrupled over the past two decades. In the last year, outrage over concert ticket prices has grown even louder, as inflated resale markets and surge pricing have left some fans in the dust when it comes to seeing their favourite artists on tour. In January, top executives from Ticketmaster and Live Nation appeared before the U.S. Senate to argue they do not hold a ticket sale monopoly. The federal questioning was spurred on by a fumbled Taylor Swift ticket presale that allegedly saw software bots illegally obtain tickets and snub thousands of eager fans. Ticketmaster merged with Live Nation in 2010, reportedly resulting in control of more than 70 per cent of the primary ticketing and live event venues market. A full list of artists included in Live Nation Concert Week can be viewed on the Live Nation website.",

    title: "A brief history of scalping concert tickets",
    description:
      "There are few things more frustrating to a music fan than being shut out of a sold-out concert only to see tickets for sale at inflated prices on the secondary market. And how do those guys selling tickets on the street outside the venue get their inventory? Scalpers (“ticket touters” to the British and “leveraged arbitragers” to ardent capitalists) are as old as live events themselves. When the Greeks opened the first-ever outdoor amphitheatre in 325 BCE — it was built into the hillside of the Acropolis and sat up to 17,000 people in its 55 semi-circular rows — there was no doubt some dude in a robe outside the gates yelling “Who’s got seats?” The same would have happened at the first Roman theatre in Pompeii in 80 BCE. And I’d lay money on the same thing happening outside of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre for the premiere of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1604. Scalping (a term that first appeared in the 19th century referring to brokers of railway tickets) has always been a problem. How could a regular person get into shows when there were crowds of “ticket speculators” and “sidewalk men” who employed people to stand in line for them (“diggers) and had secret access to insiders at the box office who gladly handed over tickets for a cut of the proceeds (known as “ice”)? When Jenny Lind, a singer known as “The Swedish Nightingale,” toured the United States in 1851, the very best seats in the house mysteriously disappeared immediately only to reappear in the hands of speculators who sold them with significant markups. A ticket with a face value of $3 might go for $6. There was a rumour that Lind’s agents were in on the scam, something that damaged her in the eyes of the public. When Charles Dickens went on a book tour of America in 1867, his public readings sold out in minutes. George Dolby, Dickens’ manager, lamented about a show in Boston. “[B]y eight o’clock in the morning, the queue [outside the box office] was nearly half a mile long and about the time that the employers of the persons who had been standing in the streets all night began to arrive to take their places. … [T]he horrid speculators who buy all the good tickets and sell them again at exorbitant prices.” In New York, fans waiting in line were offered as much as twenty dollars for their place in line by scalpers looking to acquire tickets. Dickens hated this, especially since he and his manager were accused of being in on the swindle. He wrote to his sister-in-law: “We are at wits; end how to keep tickets out of the hands of speculators. … The young under-graduates of Cambridge have made a representation to Longfellow that they are five hundred strong and cannot get one ticket.” Time and time again, theatres, performers, managers, agents, promoters, and governments have tried to clamp down on scalping. In 1927, New York City looked into the situation with Broadway theatres and local music halls. Nothing happened. The same with an investigation in 1949. And again in 1963. Nothing, it seemed, could be done about a black market in theatre tickets that totalled millions of dollars each year. It wasn’t uncommon for a box office manager to earn beyond $25,000 a year and buy a new Cadillac every year. Guess where that supplementary income came from? The problem only became bigger when rock concerts became big business. In the days before computers, box offices had racks of printed tickets, the best of which vanished before sales even began. Maintaining an accurate ticket count (and thus a proper accounting of revenue) was impossible using the system of hard tickets sold through a box office. Surely there had to be a solution. This is where the first computerized ticket-selling programs came into existence. The first, Computicket and TRS (Ticket Reservation Services), arrived in the middle 1960s, prompting their systems as a way to cut down on scalping by keeping track of every single ticket sold. Great in theory, but despite decades of advancements with computerized ticket selling, paperless tickets, and fan-driven ticket exchanges, scalpers and secondary-market companies still manage to get their hands on tickets. The problem is not going away. In fact, things are just getting weirder and more contentious with things like Ticketmaster’s professional reseller program. “Diggers” and “ice” also still exist in the digital realm. Instead of bribing box office managers and hiring people to stand in line, they use bots, fake identities, access comp tickets, and infiltrate sales meant for fan clubs. They’re pretty resourceful and tech-savvy people. This past Friday, Jan. 20, Madonna started selling tickets for her worldwide 40th-anniversary Celebration Tour, Ticketmaster’s first major on-sale challenge since the Taylor Swift fiasco late last year. Although tickets were advertised for as little as $40, you have to wonder how many of those made it into the hands of fans at that price and how many are now controlled by the secondary market (StubHub, SeatGeek, Vivid Tickets, etc.) as well as individual scalpers. Also this week, a new campaign called Make Tickets Fair launched in the U.K. and EU. The goal is to educate the public about the perils and protocols of ticket reselling. It may help a little bit, but I can’t help feeling that organizers are wasting their breath. It all comes down to this: When you have a perishable high-demand commodity like a concert ticket, someone is always going to find a way to make money from someone else’s desires. It’s a game of Whack-A-Mole as old as live entertainment itself.",

    title: "Arcade Fire ticket holders struggle to get money back",
    description:
      "Sarah Taylor and her husband were excited to go see one of their favorite artists Beck play at Rogers Place in Edmonton on Sunday, November 27. Beck was part of the Arcade Fire tour but backed out in October after Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler was accused of sexual misconduct. Butler has denied the allegations. “The main act that we were going to see was Beck,” Taylor said. “We’ve seen Arcade Fire and they’re great, but that wasn’t really our vibe so we decided to get a refund.” The Calgary woman tried to get a refund through Ticketmaster but had no luck. She’s listed them on StubHub at a fraction of the price they paid for them which was $300. As of Sunday morning, many tickets were going for $50 or less on the site. “I was totally naïve in thinking that this would be a straightforward return process,” Taylor said. “I’ve never been to a point where I’ve just been shut down at every step of the way. I’ve tried to email, I’ve tried to call, I’ve tried to go through all of their apps. “We haven’t been able to list them on Ticketmaster and at this point, we’re just so frustrated with the process so we just decided we are going to take a loss and not go to the show,” Taylor said. She and her husband ended up cancelling their hotel room for the weekend in Edmonton. There is no official process to get a refund but some have had success. When Roxanne Harde found out about the accusations against Butler, she said she was disappointed and wanted to stand by the alleged victims. “None of us wanted to see Win Butler and Arcade Fire so we decided at that point let’s just go anyway and we will go see Beck and then go out for dinner,” said Harde who had purchased five tickets for a total of $2,000. But when Beck cancelled, the Camrose woman also wanted her money back. “It was just a nightmare. There was no way to get (a refund) through the Ticketmaster website. It was just a loop that they put you into,” Harde said. “So my daughter and I started trolling Ticketmaster, Arcade Fire, and then eventually, Live Nation on social media,” Harde added that her daughter got some DM‘s from people who had gotten a refund through Live Nation Alberta. “I contacted Live Nation Alberta through Facebook and started a conversation and just kept at it,” she said. “This was about 15 messages a day saying that I have talked to a lawyer and I’m willing to engage in a class-action suit. Harde said she finally heard back from Live Nation Alberta and got her $2,000 back this week. “It was insane because I mean we were literally being trolls. Just direct messaging and replying on Facebook and on Twitter saying I want a refund. You lost Beck. It’s not the show that I paid for. I want a refund, with that message over and over again probably I’m guessing more than 50 posts,” Harde said. “What it did actually take was for people to see those posts and message us to say, ‘Hey I got a refund and this is how I did it.'” Harde said government needs to step in to hold companies accountable. She said she feels as though consumers are not being protected. “I actually talked to a lawyer about a class-action suit because I think there should be one. I think that the band and Ticketmaster and Live Nation need to be held accountable,” Harde said Two online petitions have been created asking Ticketmaster to offer the option of a refund. Arcade Fire plays in Toronto on December 1 and 2. RELATED NEWS",
